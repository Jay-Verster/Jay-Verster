# Hi, Iâ€™m Jeandre Verster, but most people call me Jay.

I'm an aspiring data scientist currently studying part-time for my BSc(Hons) in Data Science through the Open University UK. I take a hybrid approach when it comes to my education. Apart from my degree modules, I follow structured courses and bootcamps on various platforms such as EdX, uDemy and Coursera. Alternatively when I come across a subject that peaks my curiousity, I use self-study & educational resources to broaden my understanding. I am a firm believer in learning through experience, hence most of my projects you will come across on my GitHub pages are made from scratch, even if the intitial idea was introduced through coursework or an instructor, I always attempt to take a unique approach to creating solutions.
